# Web Development Project 2

## What was this project for?
* This is a project to put into practice some CSS features, such as: *transform*, *transition*, *animation with @keyframes*, *Flexbox* and *iframes*. It only uses html and CSS.

## Areas of improvement:
* Since this was just a project to test how much I had learn at that point, the webpage could be improved by considering some features I hadn't learned about at that time, such as making it responsive.

## How to improve the project:
* Keep adding features to make the webpage responsive.
* Learn how to use Javascript to improve the webpage.
* Turn the webpage into a website.
* Add a navigation menu, so that the visitor can go straight to where he wants to in the website.
